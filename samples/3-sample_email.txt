                                                  Update your ID Badge!

Hi John,
Healthcare guidelines require personnel in hospitals to wear an updated identification.
Make sure you have an up-to-date ID photo to complete our security validation.

Are you an essential employee and worker such as doctor, nurse or medical assistant? Or planning to visit a hospital in the next few days? We will do our best to set up your ID Badge Update as quickly as possible.

Please add your details, upload a new photo and get an updated ID badge!

                                                  Update your ID badge
